# Cats-pests
Cats are kind of useful and adorable pests - so long as one isn't allergic to their dander or fur.

Cats are rather AMAZING animals and I miss the cats I love and who were the only ones who have been there for me when I was trying to get to a good place mentally and emotionally due to some personal history that is still rather deeply painful and not easy for me to discuss with anyone else unless they have been through something similar - which I won't and don't wish to ever happen to anyone.
