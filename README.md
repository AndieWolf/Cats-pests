# Cats-pests

Cats are kind of useful and adorable pests - so long as one isn't allergic to their dander or fur.

Cats are rather AMAZING animals and I miss the cats I love and who were the only ones who have been there for me when I was trying to get to a good place mentally and emotionally due to some personal history that is still rather deeply painful and not easy for me to discuss with anyone else unless they have been through something similar - which I won't and don't wish to ever happen to anyone. 

Cats are kind of useful in that one doesn't usually have an issue with rodents sharing the same living space with any cats - it's a matter of survival for the rodents and a matter of personal space for the cats.  This is good for you and me if we don't want the more annoying pests known as mice and/or rats residing in our homes with ourselves and our rather AMAZING cats and making our homes into a filthy, smelly place that neither us nor the cats really care about residing in at that point in time.

Cats are adorable when they want the attention of the HUMAN they have chosen to be theirs. They are needing a place to live in and most of them are fine with not being able to get outside and risk getting hurt and/or taken away from the HUMAN or HUMANS that they have chosen to be with.  They tend to want to be touched when they are in the mood for some attention from the HUMAN SLAVE (s) that they are bonded with and without the help of the other HUMANS that may be around the same living space as they are a little bit possessive of the HUMAN or HUMANS that they have chosen to be in the same living space with. Other HUMANS can be considered as mediocre (at best) and ( rather pathetic at the worst) substitutes for the primary reason that any other HUMANS are very nice to have around if the primary HUMAN or HUMANS are not available to meet the requirements for the cats' desire for the attention of the HUMAN or HUMANS that they have chosen to be in the same living space with. They will do things that are really rather hilarious and awesomely cute and/or a little dangerous for themselves and/or the HUMAN SLAVE(s) that they have chosen for the time being and yet, if you want to get a pic of what the cats are doing to get the chance to get the attention from the HUMAN SLAVE or HUMAN SLAVES that they have access to, you'll have to be a little bit sneaky as cats are very dignified and tend to want to be seen as a little bit aloof and a good time to actually be able to get a good pic of the cat(s) is while they are taking one of the several times per day naps that they require to be in your time, and space, and help them with the whole thing - by making sure you are seemingly not aware of where the cats actually do take their naps and approximately when. However, it's a good thing to have a good phone or a good camera for taking the pic of the cats with pretty much with you all the time you're welcome around the same living space with the cats - they have a tendency to be in a rather compromising position with a good friend of theirs and a person who they are comfortable with available for taking the picture(s) of them with the whole intent of showing the HUMAN or HUMANS that the cats have chosen for the companion or companions that they are going to be in the same living space with for as long as they seem it important to be there; at which point, they will either choose a different HUMAN or maybe they will leave the house of the now, unimportant HUMAN or HUMANS that they no longer wish to be in the same living space with - and, you can't stop them from doing it either.  

Cats are pests in that they have a lot of time to figure out how to get the chance to get the required attention from the HUMAN or HUMANS that they choose to live with; they are very good at making sure that you are not feeling like a good person if you aren't busy with either getting the cats the same type of attention from the HUMAN SLAVE or something like a specific toy and/or something else like a freshly cleaned litter box and/or fresh and clean food and water in the properly cleaned and fully ready for the cats to use dishes.  If you're not going to be able to give them the reassurance that you'll be totally able and willing to cater to the cats' needs, you can be sure that the cats are doing well to make sure that the HUMAN or HUMANS that they have chosen prior to meeting you are really and truly aware of the fact that you didn't get the cats what they had indicated that they were in an apparently desperate need of in what the cats consider a timely manner and therefore, you don't deserve to be allowed to be in the same room with the cats, let alone the same house as the cats.  They are truly the Ruling Class of the living space that they have to share with the HUMAN or HUMANS that they have chosen to be in a bit of a strong bond with from the time that they met their HUMAN SLAVE or SLAVES; I was chosen by a very small, yet very adorable little girl when she was just a little bit past like a week and a half old - I thought that I was going to help the foster parents to take care of her and her 4 siblings so that they would have a good chance to get taken away to good homes and be loved and wanted and appreciated.  Little did I know that when I was feeding the young lady kitten with the mitten paws, that she had already chosen for me to be the HUMAN SLAVE that she wanted and needed and who was the one that was in a bit of a rough place to start to deal with the aforementioned personal history of my life and that I would be able to give you a guide to dealing with cats.  Her name was Bonnie and I named her after the 1st WM who was allowed to join Marine Corps. special forces - which was known as Force Recon. She was killed a few years ago and it sent me into one Hell of a major tailspin when I lost her - she was more than just a cat, she was my ESA - Emotional Support Animal; and the other ESA that I had finally acquired is now in an animal shelter and I don't know how I will be able to keep up seemingly functioning like I'm not missing the much appreciated and needed attention from my new ESA as I currently have no place to keep her and she is extremely important to my mental health and well being, as is the only ESA that my best friend has is just as important for his mental health and well being as he has been in the same living space with my best friend and myself ,- the 2 young ESAs are from the same litter of kittens and are truly a great blessing to me and my best friend.

Cats are SO very good at the same time as they seem to be a good friend of those people who are not feeling like they are worthy of being able to get a good relationship with a good HUMAN, so that they (the cats) can get some of the HUMAN SLAVE(s) in the same living space with the cats and show the HUMAN or HUMANS that they are not going to be able to leave the cats in a bad situation with the whole intent of showing the HUMAN SLAVE or SLAVES that they have chosen that they are most assuredly worthy of being loved by such an amazingly awesome being as the cats are aware that they are (all cats are aware that they were worshipped as though they were Gods back in ancient times in Egypt and the cats are doing well to make sure that they are going to be taken care of, loved, cherished, and a good little bit spoiled as they are in the process of teaching the HUMAN SLAVE or SLAVES that they are the Ones Who MUST be taken care of regardless of what the HUMAN SLAVE or SLAVES have to do or if they have any way to get the required needs of the cats met properly (per the cats determination, of course), and with the HUMAN SLAVE or SLAVES that they have chosen to be in the same living space with are of significant importance to the cats' will and desires and we (the HUMAN SLAVES) are still in the process of learning how to do it the way that the cats are requiring of us as they are well aware that the HUMAN SLAVE or SLAVES are still in a bit of awe of them (the cats). So.  Since the cats are requiring the HUMAN SLAVE or SLAVES to be in the same living space with them and to cater to the cats'will and desires and the cats are aware that we are going to make sure that they have any way to get the required needs of the cats met to the very best for the time that they (the cats) are in our lives and in our homes underfoot and the cats are doing well to make sure that the HUMAN SLAVE or SLAVES that they have chosen to be in a strong bonded relationship with are the best for the time being and yet, that is a good thing:  I have known cats since I was a young child and I'm in my mid-40's now - they have made me laugh and have been through the same things I have had to deal with; right now, I'm missing a few of my favorite cats and I have to hope that I'll be able to get a good place for the cats and my best friend and myself to live asap because my best friend and I have to get a new place for the cats and ourselves and we will be doing our best to make it happen as quickly as we possibly can because of the cats' needs which are of course the same things as they are aware that they have to get taken care of by the HUMANS that they have chosen to be in the same living space with as they have been through the same houseless situation that my best friend and I are dealing with at this time. We feel like we are letting our cats down and that we are pretty pathetic and we are going to have to do this getting a new place to live with the cats in as much of a major hurry as we can due to some rather unfortunate reasons that we are going to be doing our best to make sure that we get remedied as effectively and as efficiently as we possibly can. Those cats are so hugely important that they are going to be the driving force for us to get an at least decent place for the cats and ourselves to be in the same living space with each other again for the sake of the much-needed peace of mind and body that we'll all have once we are back in the same living space with the cats and then, we will have to be on guard to protect the cats and ourselves a lot better than we had done before.  

Cats are kind of useful and also kind of pests at the same time; however, they are going to do what they want to do when they are ready to do it regardless of what you want them to do or not do:. They will do the same thing as they are going to be in the same living space with you, so you had best adjust yourself to the fact that the cats are remarkably well aware that THEY were Gods back in ancient times and in a very major way, they are still worshipped as though they are still Gods today - which is unsurprising for the cats are doing the HUMAN SLAVE or SLAVES a good favor:. they are still acting like the Gods that they are well aware that they were worshipped as so long ago and making sure that the HUMAN SLAVE or SLAVES that they choose to be in a bonded relationship with are just as aware as the cats are that the cats are still enjoying the same treatment that they are remembering from the HUMAN SLAVE or SLAVES who worshipped the cats in ancient times and in the same living space with the cats and that we are not going to have to be in the same bad living situation that we were not able to prevent from turning SO very badly due to some rather unfortunate circumstances that we weren't able to get control of in the process of getting a new place to live with the cats.
